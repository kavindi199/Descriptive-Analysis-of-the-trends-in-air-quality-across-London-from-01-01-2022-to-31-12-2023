This project aims to analyze and discover trends in air quality across London based on data collected at 36 air monitoring sites from 01/01/2022 to 31/12/2023. 
The dataset, "london local data 2022," contains hourly measurements of NO2, NOx, NO, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, with some missing observations. 
Additionally, the "london local sites" dataset provides details of each monitoring site. 
Through this project, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover significant patterns and trends in the air quality across London. 
Our findings can help inform policies and strategies to improve air quality in the city.
